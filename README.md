Once a student is selected from the dropdown, the right side of the program allows adding courses and their associated grades.
Once all courses are added, clicking "Calculate GPA and Save to File" will display the calculated grade point average and save the entered data to XML files.

Saved courses will now be displayed on the left side of the program, where users can select courses and either send to the calculator to update their grades, or delete them from the save file.
To remove a student from the system, select the student from the dropdown menu, and click "Delete Student"
